Breast Cancer survival rate
We propose to develop a bioinformatics tool 
that can predict breast cancer survivability rate 
by integrating omics data. We will use 
exploratory data analysis to identify the most 
important features for predicting survivability rate, 
and we will develop machine learning models to train the tool.
